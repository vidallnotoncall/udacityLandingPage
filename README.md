To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/vidallnotoncall/udacityLandingPage```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project is a template of sorts for landing pages. It auto creates new tabs based on section names provided in data nav attribute. 

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To keep functionality make sure when you add a new section to also add the section title to the data nav. If you want a new scroll to top button just change the element. If you use the same class anything can be used as a scroll to top button. Another way would be to add the new selected element to the scrollToTop function.
